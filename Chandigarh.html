        <p>Chandigarh is a modern city known for its beautiful urban design and architecture. It serves as the capital of two Indian states, Haryana and Punjab.</p>
        <p>
            Chandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design.[8] The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. Chandigarh's Capitol Complex—as part of a global ensemble of Corbusier's buildings—was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 40th session of the World Heritage Conference in July 2016.[9]
            
            Chandigarh has grown greatly since its initial construction, and has also driven the development of Mohali and Panchkula; the "tri-city" metropolitan area has a combined population of over 1,611,770.[10] The city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the country. The union territory has one of the highest Human Development Index among Indian states and territories.[11] In 2015, a survey by LG Electronics ranked it as the happiest city in India on the happiness index.[12][13][14] In 2015, an article published by BBC named Chandigarh one of the few master-planned cities in the world to have succeeded in terms of combining monumental architecture, cultural growth, and modernisation.</p>

Hundreds of parrots live here. They fly in flocks in the morning and evening from here. There are two parks adjoining to this sanctuary. Flocks of parrots sit on the trees of these parks also. It is the second wildlife sanctuary of Chandigarh. Sukhna wildlife sanctuary near Sukhna Lake is another wildlife sanctuary of the city. It is notified under Section 18 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

                        The parrots wake up and sleep as per Photoperiodism. The Municipal Corporation of U.T., Chandigarh installed high post lights affecting the sleep pattern of the parrots. The Tribune (Chandigarh) highlighted the problem caused to the parrots after a local resident and bird lover, Harman Singh Sidhu brought it to their notice. The Wildlife Department, Chandigarh was apprised of the problem and the high post lights were switched off.
                        
                        The park is also known for its beautifully designed benches, which the teenagers popularly refer to as "Taj Mahal Benches".</p></td>

                                Sukhna is an inseparable part of the city of Chandigarh. The city planners were deeply attached to the lake. So much so that Pierre Jeanneret's ashes were immersed in the lake in 1970 at his niece's request.

The roof of the 'bandh' or dam has become a favourite promenade. Serious walkers pursue an exercise regime, families enjoy an evening stroll and nature lovers mingle with children on roller skates. Photographers and painters love to capture the scenic beauty of the setting sun or the heavily used monsoon sky, or the early morning mist in winter set amidst the tranquillity of the lake. Even anglers do not leave unrewarded.

Sukhna has a membership-based Lake Club with lawns, a gym, indoor games, swimming pools (more than 4), and large tennis courts with both grass and synthetic courts. Boating,[2] rowing, sculling, sailing, kayaking, and water-skiing can be enjoyed throughout the year.

The lake, which was the venue for the Asian Rowing Championships, has the longest channel for rowing and yachting events in Asia.
